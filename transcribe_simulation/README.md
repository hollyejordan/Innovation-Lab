If yuo wish to run this:

# Node
In cmd go to /node/ and run the command "npm i"

Run the command "npm run build" in the dir
/node/packages/shared

Run the command "npm run start"
in both
/node/packages/app
and
/node/packages/server

These need to be in their own cmd terminal

# C++
Open the .sln and build

# Done
Give them a few seconds, they should all connect. Output is received in the c++
console.

They will all auto reconnect to each other
